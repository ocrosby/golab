# Go

The SOLID principles are essentially a set of rules for helping you write clean
and maintainable object-oriented code.

* Single responsibility
* Open/closed
* Liskov substitution
* Interface segregation
* Dependency inversion

Go is an object-based programming language.

## The Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)

Object implementations should focus on doing one thing well, and in an efficient
way.

## Open/closed

## Liskov substitution

## Interface segregation

## Dependency inversion
